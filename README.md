## Description

The goal is to create resume (CV) page using React components. It wasn't just to replicate a design but to explore new concepts while building the page. Instead of cramming everything into one HTML file, I should broke down the page into smaller, reusable components. This approach not only makes the code more organized but also allows for easier maintenance and scalability.
